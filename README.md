### About
I liked the locking sidebar on Notion.so workspace page, so I tried an almost looking vanilla JS recreation. DOM manipulation, Eventlisteners are loud here.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS3

### How to use

- Clone the repository, or copy/paste from Git.
- Open index.html on browser.

##### Note
It imitates the Desktop version of workspace better than the mobile version.
This is not an exact sidebar construction but works as a proof of concept.
